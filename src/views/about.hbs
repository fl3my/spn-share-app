    shop itself being utilised as a training facility.</p>
  <p>The Scottish Pantry Network will support the pantries by being the
    collective voice for change, we forge strong partnerships to support the
    development of the hub model, creating a tailored experience for local
    communities. The Network will provide ongoing support to the pantries
    through compliance, lobbying and creating links with food suppliers.</p>
